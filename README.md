# vaillant-calormatic340f

Helper files (utilities, data/signal dumps in decoded form, dead-end approached, etc.) for my decoding project of the Vailland calorMatic 340f wireless central heating control. The documentation of the protocol (i.e. the results obtained with these tools) can be found at http://wiki.kainhofer.com/hardware/vaillantvrt340f.
